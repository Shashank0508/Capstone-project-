However, the front camera remains the same as the iPhone 15.\n\nBattery Life: No significant changes in battery performance compared to the iPhone 15.\n\nDesign & Build: The new titanium body feels premium and sturdy in hand.\n\nDisplay: The screen is excellent, but when using a case, the difference in display quality between the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 15 becomes less discernible.\n\nIf you own an iPhone 15, this upgrade may not offer enough to justify the switch. However, if you have an iPhone 13 or older, the iPhone 16 Pro is a substantial upgrade worth considering.', 'helpful_votes': 213, 'images': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zIeb0FsoL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71716mGMu3L._SY88.jpg'], 'extracted_at': '2025-05-17T12:10:42.199733'}

The rest of the experience otherwise was great.\nThe package arrived in a good condition. I was skeptical about making a major purchase off of Amazon but phew, it just all happened without any issues.\nWorth the upgrade if going from iPhone 13 or older, cause there’s a lot of changes from the previous slightly older models.\nThe battery initially seemed to be draining pretty fast, but once I updated the phone to the latest ios somehow the battery life got better. Not sure if it’s with all the iPhones, just an observation from my side.', 'helpful_votes': 15, 'images': [], 'extracted_at': '2025-05-17T12:10:42.666549'}
