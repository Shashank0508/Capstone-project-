From the moment I placed the order, the entire experience was seamless. The PS5 arrived on time, and the packaging was secure, ensuring it arrived in perfect condition.\nAs a first-time console owner, I was excited yet a bit anxious about setting everything up, but the process was incredibly easy.

The seller is reliable in the sense that I have recieved a genuine Sony PS5 Slim console (disc edition) in perfect condition that opens up new vistas in the world of gaming. This console is a must-have asset for pro and normal gamers. But, one thing to note, please don't expect any after-sales-support from the seller, as I have experienced in my case, when I observed that the yellow warranty card, meant for India, was missing in the console's package, and contacted the seller for support, and unfortunately received no response! Then, I contacted Sony India customer care both over the phone and email, sent the copy of the invoice as generated by the seller, a snapshot of the serial number on the bottom side of the company box, as well as the serial number on the bottom side of the console itself. Next, within a few days, the warranty card was sent by Sony through courier to my residence. Kudos for Sony for this wonderful service! Wish the seller had been equally responsible and prompt in handling customers' issues. However, at the end I hope everything will go well and extend my heartfelt thanks to the seller and Sony for their respective services.",

That portable console was the best to play with and I believe it still is very relevant to this date. And my first phone purchase was the Sony Xperia C and to this date I can say that I was a very proud and satisfied owner of that phone.\n\nThe Sony PlayStation 5 is a beast. It is amazing to play with. I was very nervous since this was my first major gaming console purchase and I had been waiting for a PlayStation since more than a decade now. All I can say is I am the happiest at this moment and I am glad that I bought this. Now, just waiting for GTA 6 to release! ;)",
