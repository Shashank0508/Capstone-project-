However, the front camera remains the same as the iPhone 15.\n\nBattery Life: No significant changes in battery performance compared to the iPhone 15.\n\nDesign & Build: The new titanium body feels premium and sturdy in hand.\n\nDisplay: The screen is excellent, but when using a case, the difference in display quality between the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 15 becomes less discernible.\n\nIf you own an iPhone 15, this upgrade may not offer enough to justify the switch. However, if you have an iPhone 13 or older, the iPhone 16 Pro is a substantial upgrade worth considering.",

The rest of the experience otherwise was great.\nThe package arrived in a good condition. I was skeptical about making a major purchase off of Amazon but phew, it just all happened without any issues.\nWorth the upgrade if going from iPhone 13 or older, cause there’s a lot of changes from the previous slightly older models.\nThe battery initially seemed to be draining pretty fast, but once I updated the phone to the latest ios somehow the battery life got better. Not sure if it’s with all the iPhones, just an observation from my side.",

However, I was finally relieved to see that the package was genuine, and the iPhone itself was the real deal. 😂\n\nI ordered the black model, and the color is sleek. I love it! 🖤\n\nIf you’re coming from an older iPhone model like the 13 Pro or earlier, or if you’re new to the Apple ecosystem, this is a great upgrade. However, I don’t think it’s worth upgrading from an iPhone 15 Pro if you’re a casual user. There’s not much of a difference between the two, except that you’ll be holding the latest iPhone. 😉",

You just start using the camera even for short duration it will get heated significantly. Or You do something intensive task like insta reel edit/upload, erase object from photos (when i used this feature phone got crashed and rebooted). I was in impression that okay it will feel warm before purchasing. But it’s a heater that will be felt at frame as well as back.\n2. A genius camera button jisko apni existance kyun hai, Pata nahi. I used this button only when i need to shoot immediately but while shooting in portrait display mode it will zoom in/out accidentally because of this button touch sensitivity which results in quality of photo.\n3.Ceramic glass is kachchi kali for scratches. It got so many scratches in 1 month usage not major but i was taking care but still it got.\n4. Glitches in UI. Okay android companies making so many products in so may have difficulty to maintain bug free UI. But my samsung phone was superior in UI management.\n5. Placements of volume and lock buttons. So many times it has taken screenshots while operating volume buttons as other this lock button will get pressed to hold/generate the pressure.\n\nMy desires for a phone was the great camera system and in that it’s performing well but expectations versus reality m kahin na kahin maza nahi aaya.",
