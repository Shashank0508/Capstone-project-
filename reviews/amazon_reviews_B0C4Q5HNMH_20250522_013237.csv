RX47NMJHWV722,Dibyanshu,5.0,Product Review: NoiseFit Halo 2 Smartwatch – 5 Stars!,"I recently got the NoiseFit Halo 2, and I must say, it's absolutely fantastic! This watch has exceeded all my expectations in terms of both performance and style.

The AMOLED display is stunning—super vibrant, bright even under sunlight, and incredibly responsive. The build quality feels premium with its sleek metallic frame, and the strap is very comfortable for all-day wear.

In terms of features, it's packed! Bluetooth calling works seamlessly, the health tracking is accurate (heart rate, SpO2, sleep monitoring, everything), and the sports modes cover almost every activity I do. The battery life is impressive too, easily lasting 5-6 days on a single charge.

Also, the user interface is smooth and easy to navigate, and the NoiseFit app gives detailed insights that really help me keep track of my fitness.

Overall, this is an extremely good smartwatch—great value for money, stylish, feature-rich, and reliable. I’m giving it a solid 5-star rating and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet premium smartwatch!",10 April 2025,India,True,Colour: BlackStyle Name: Metal Strap,0,,2025-05-22T01:32:32.872275

R1D1A7WZALOQ3,Malay Shah,4.0,Best at the price range,"Its been a month since am using the product and I would say am totally satisfied with what is offered at the price range. Being a fitbit band user before, from accuracy point its not up to the mark but still its quite reliable.

Pros and cons as per per my usage
Design: Design looks premium and with leather belt looks quite a premium.

Features: Am not a fan of too many features and rather quality and reliability of the feature which is being offered. Considering that it has almost all the basic features and they are quite reliable.

Battery life: Am quite amazed at the battery life. With moderate usage keeping phone call off keeping only notifications on, am getting around a week's battery back up which is impressive.

Cons:
Accuracy: Being a fitbit owned user, I feel accuracy of the reading is not that accurate but would consider just ok with most the user(for atletics where reading should be accurate, woyld not recomment)

Heart Rate: There is no continious HR monitor, it can be kept manual or automatic every five 5 mins which is fine but a continuous reading qould be more beneficial. Also app doesnt calculate resting heart rate which i was been habitual with.

Customization: It has less customization, as in you cannot customize the menu screen or widget ordering and even app design coupd have been better.",26 November 2024,India,True,Colour: Vintage BrownStyle Name: Leather strap,20,,2025-05-22T01:32:33.258422
