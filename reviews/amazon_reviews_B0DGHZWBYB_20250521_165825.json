      "body": "I am writing to formally complain about my recent purchase of an iPhone 16 from online on Amazon.\nI received the item on the same day of purchase, but upon unboxing, I noticed that the iPhone came in a mismatched (muddled) box. When I powered it on, the phone was stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen, repeatedly displaying ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in multiple languages. It was completely unresponsive‚Äînone of the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, were functioning.\n\nAfter approximately five hours, the battery finally drained, and the phone shut down. However, after restarting, the same issue persisted, with the device stuck on the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen again.\n\nI contacted Amazon‚Äôs support team, who advised me to reach out to Apple Support. Apple Support suggested some troubleshooting steps, but none resolved the issue. Ultimately, they advised me to visit an Apple-authorized service center for a software reinstallation‚Äîon a brand-new phone.\n\nI then had to travel 5 km to a Maple (Apple-authorized) service center, where they reinstalled the software. The process took about 45‚Äì50 minutes, finally making the phone functional.\n\nI am extremely disappointed with this experience. After purchasing a costly device, I suffered an entire day of inconvenience due to the seller‚Äôs inefficiency or the company‚Äôs negligence in quality control. This is unacceptable, especially for a premium product.\n\nPreviously, I had purchased an iPhone 15 online without any issues, but this time, the experience was frustrating and disappointing. I strongly urge you to take action against this seller for supplying what appears to be old or improperly stored stock.\n\nI request appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and mental stress caused. Additionally, I advise other customers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller.\n\nI hope Amazon takes this matter seriously and ensures such incidents do not happen again.",
