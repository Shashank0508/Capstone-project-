      "body": "Its been a month since am using the product and I would say am totally satisfied with what is offered at the price range. Being a fitbit band user before, from accuracy point its not up to the mark but still its quite reliable.\n\nPros and cons as per per my usage\nDesign: Design looks premium and with leather belt looks quite a premium.\n\nFeatures: Am not a fan of too many features and rather quality and reliability of the feature which is being offered. Considering that it has almost all the basic features and they are quite reliable.\n\nBattery life: Am quite amazed at the battery life. With moderate usage keeping phone call off keeping only notifications on, am getting around a week's battery back up which is impressive.\n\nCons:\nAccuracy: Being a fitbit owned user, I feel accuracy of the reading is not that accurate but would consider just ok with most the user(for atletics where reading should be accurate, woyld not recomment)\n\nHeart Rate: There is no continious HR monitor, it can be kept manual or automatic every five 5 mins which is fine but a continuous reading qould be more beneficial. Also app doesnt calculate resting heart rate which i was been habitual with.\n\nCustomization: It has less customization, as in you cannot customize the menu screen or widget ordering and even app design coupd have been better.",
